                    Being a goliath, MULK thinks he is more interesting than a mere human! 
                    <br>
                    He is proud of all the training he did to become a barbarian. 
                    <br>
                    He continues to train hard so that he may become a barbarian of a higher level!

                <p id="stats">
                    The six ability scores paint a picture of a character's physical and mental traits.
                    <br>
                    MULK might not be as charismatic as a bard but he's certain he's strong enough to beat one at arm wrestling!
                    <br>
                    There are a few ways of setting your character's abilities, rolling for stats being the most exciting one!
                    <br>
                    How to roll for stats:
                    <ul id="statsul">
                        <li>Roll 4d6 (four six-sided dice).</li>
                        <li>Note down the sum of the highest three rolls.</li>
                        <li>Repeat the above five more times.</li>
                        <li>You now have six numbers, and you can assign each to a different ability score as you wish.</li>
                    </ul>
                    <p id="statsp">
                    To get the corresponding modifier, take away 10 from an ability score, 
                    divide the outcome by 2 and round down the answer if required.
                    <br>
                    With an impressive score of 17, MULK's strength modifier is +3!
                    <br>
                    See <a href="#stskills">Saving Throws and Skills</a> for more insight on modifiers.
                    </p>

            </details>

        <div>
            <details>
                <summary>Saving Throws and Skills</summary>
                <p id="stskills">
                    Skills determine whether a character is likely to perform well or not when attempting a task.
                    <br>
                    Each skill is based on an ability, so, e.g., MULK's strength means that he is very athletic!
                    <br>
                    Saving throws are made to defend against threats.
                    <br>
                    When a player performs a skill check or a saving throw, they roll 1d20 and add the relevant modifier to the outcome.
                    <br>
                    The higher their score is the more likely that their character will be successful.
                    <br>
                    If the character is proficient in a skill or a saving throw, 
                    then the player can also add the character's <a href="#pbonus">Proficiency Bonus</a> to the roll.

                <summary>Initiative</summary>
                <p id="initiative">
                    When the players are in a hostile situation, everyone involved in the encounter must roll initiative before it begins.
                    <br>
                    This determines the order in which the combatants take turns, 
                    with the combatant with the highest initiative check getting to act first. 
                    <br>
                    Rolling for initiative is a Dexterity check, hence MULK's initiative score will be determined as 1d20+2.
                </p>

                <summary>Armour Class</summary>
                <p id="armcl">
                    Armour Class, or AC, represents how well the character will be able to avoid getting hit in battle.
                    <br>
                    Without armour or shield, AC is calculated as 10 + Dexterity modifier.
                    <br>
                    However since MULK is a Barbarian 
                    (see <a href="https://www.dndbeyond.com/classes/barbarian#UnarmoredDefense-52" target="_blank">Unarmored Defense</a>), 
                    if he doesn't wear any armour he also gets to add his Constitution modifier,
                    giving a total AC of 16! 
                    <br>

                </p>

                <summary>Proficiency Bonus</summary>
                <p id="pbonus">
                    Proficiency Bonus increases at certain levels 
                    and can added to numbers when dealing with things the character is proficient in.
                    <br>
                    Note that MULK is proficient at using martial weapons 
                    (see the PROFICIENCIES AND LANGUAGES box in the <a href="#chshimg">character sheet</a>).
                    <br>
                    Hence when the player rolls 1d20 to attack with MULK's greataxe, 
                    they can add +2, the Proficiency Bonus, to the roll.
                    <br>
                    Greataxe is a melee weapon, so +3, the Strength modifier, is also added to attack rolls 
                    (the Dexterity modifier is added when attacking with ranged weapons).
                    <br>
                    Therefore, +5 can be added to attack rolls for MULK's greataxe
                    (see the +5 next to Greataxe in the WEAPON ATTACKS & CANTRIPS box in the <a href="#chshimg">character sheet</a>).
                    <br>
                    If 1d20+5 is greater than or equal to the target's <abbr title="Armour Class">AC</abbr> then the attack will hit.
                    <br>
                    Yup! MULK is pretty confident about landing hits with his greataxe!

                    A character's <abbr title="Hit Points">HP</abbr> decrease in line with the damage they take.
                    <br>
                    The character goes down if they lose all their HP. They will then need to make one death save each turn.
                    <br>
                    This involves rolling 1d20:
                    <ul id="hpointsul">
                        <li>A roll of 10 or above counts as a success.</li>
                        <li>A roll lower than 10 is a failure.</li>
                        <li>3 successes make the character stable; they will remain unconscious but won't need to make any more death saves.</li>
                        <li>3 failures mean death.</li>

                    A character has a number of hit dice equal to their current level available to them.
                    <br>
                    After a short rest, the character can spend any number of their hit dice to gain lost HP.
                    <br>
                    The character is able to regain some of their spent hit dice after a long rest.
