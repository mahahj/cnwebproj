            You may be sitting around a dining table with your friends, character sheet at hand, 
            but that won't stop you from getting immersed in the adventuring world!
        </p>
        <p>
            The <abbr title="Dungeon Master">DM</abbr> will describe the surroundings to you 
            and your fellow players whose characters, along with yours, make up the adventuring party.  
        </p>
        <p>
            You can then investigate more and describe what you'd like your character to do.
            You may then be asked to roll dice which would determine how your character performs and what
            the consequences of their actions are.

            <b>DM:</b> You start to wake up. You feel that you're lying on a hard surface. 
            Your mattress at the inn was bad but not this bad! As you wake up fully, 
            you realise that you're lying inside a wooden box, much like a coffin.
            What do you do?
        </p>
        <p>
            <b>Player as MULK:</b> What? ...... WHAT IS THIS? WHO LOCKED MULK IN A BOX? LET MULK OUT WHILE MULK ASK NICELY!
            <br>
            <b>Player:</b> MULK waits for a response.
        </p>
        <p>
            <b>DM:</b> You don't hear anything in response to that.
        </p>
        <p>
            <b>Player:</b> MULK's going to start punching the box with all he's got to try and break the top open.
            <br>
            <b>Player as MULK:</b> FINE! HAVE IT YOUR WAY! YOU ACTUALLY THINK YOU CAN TRAP MULK!
            NO BOX BIG ENOUGH FOR MULK! NO BOX STRONG ENOUGH FOR MULK! MULK STRONGER THAN EVERYTHING!
        </p>
        <p>
            <b>DM:</b> Give me a Strength check.
        </p>
        <p>
            <b>Player:</b> *Rolls 1d20*. It's a natural 20!
        </p>
        <p>
            <b>DM:</b> Yup! That top's breaking!
